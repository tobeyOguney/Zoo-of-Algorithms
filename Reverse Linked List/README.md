# Reverse Linked List

Write a function that takes in the head of a Singly Linked List, reverses the list in place (i.e., doesn't create a
brand new list), and returns its new head.

Each LinkedList node has an integer value as well as a next node pointing to the next node in the list or to
None / null if it's the tail of the list.

You can assume that the input Linked List will always have at least one node; in other
words, the head will never be None / null.

Sample Input:
`0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5  // the head node with value 0`

Sample Output:
`5 -> 4 -> 3 -> 2 -> 1 -> 0  // the new head node with value 5`
