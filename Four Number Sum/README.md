# Four Number Sum

Write a function that takes in a non-empty array of distinct integers and an integer representing a target sum.
The function should find all quadruplets in the array that sum up to the target sum
and return a two-dimensional array of all these quadruplets in no particular order.

If no four numbers sum up to the target sum, the function should return an empty array.

### Sample input:
`[7, 6, 4, -1, 1, 2], 16`
### Sample output:
`[[7, 6, 4, -1], [7, 6, 1, 2]]`
