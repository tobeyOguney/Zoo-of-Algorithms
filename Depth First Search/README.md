# Depth First Search

You are given a Node class that has a name and an array of optional children Nodes. When put together, Nodes form a simple tree-like structure. Implement the
depthFirstSearch method on the Node class, which takes in an empty array, traverses the tree using the Depth-rst Search approach (specically navigating the
tree from left to right), stores all the of the Nodes' names in the input array, and returns it.

Sample input:
```
         A
       / | \
      B  C  D
     / \   / \
    E   F G   H
       / \ \
      I  J  K
```

Sample output:
```
["A","B","E","F","I","J","C","D","G","K","H"]
```
