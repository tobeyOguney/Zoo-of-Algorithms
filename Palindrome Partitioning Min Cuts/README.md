# Palindrome Partitioning Min Cuts

Given a non-empty string, write a function that returns the minimum number of cuts needed
to perform on the string such that each remaining substring is a palindrome.

A palindrome is defined as a string that is written the same forward as backward.
Note that single-character strings are palindromes.

Sample input: `"noonabbad"`

Sample output: `2 ("noon | abba | d")`
