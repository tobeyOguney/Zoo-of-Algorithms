# Balanced Bracket

Write a function that takes in a string made up of brackets `("(","[","{",")","]", and "}")` and other optional characters. The function should return a boolean
representing whether or not the string is balanced in regards to brackets. A string is said to be balanced if it has as many opening brackets of a given type as it has
closing brackets of that type and if no bracket is unmatched. Note that a closing bracket cannot match a corresponding opening bracket that comes after it.
Similarly, brackets cannot overlap each other as in `"[(])"`.

Sample input:
```
"([])(){}(())()()"
```

Sample output:
```
True (it is balanced)
```
