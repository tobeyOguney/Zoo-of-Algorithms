# Is Subsequence

Given a string **s** and a string **t**, check if **s** is subsequence of **t**.

A subsequence of a string is a new string which is formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. (ie, `"ace"` is a subsequence of `"abcde"` while `"aec"` is not).

### Example 1:

```
Input: s = "abc", t = "ahbgdc"
Output: true
```
### Example 2:

```
Input: s = "axc", t = "ahbgdc"
Output: false
```

### Constraints:

* `0 <= s.length <= 100`
* `0 <= t.length <= 10^4`
* Both strings consists only of lowercase characters.
