# Single Cycle Check

You are given an array of integers. Each integer represents a jump of its value in the array. For instance, the integer 2 represents a jump of 2 indices forward in the array; the integer -3 represents a jump of 3 indices backward in the array. If a jump spills past the array's bounds, it wraps over to the other side. For instance, a
jump of -1 at index 0 brings us to the last index in the array. Similarly, a jump of 1 at the last index in the array brings us to index 0. Write a function that returns a
boolean representing whether the jumps in the array form a single cycle. A single cycle occurs if, starting at any index in the array and following the jumps, every
element is visited exactly once before landing back on the starting index.

Sample input:
```
[2, 3, 1, -4, -4, 2]
```

Sample output:
```
True
```
