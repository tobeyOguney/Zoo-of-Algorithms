# Maximum Subset Sum With No Adjacent Elements

Write a function that takes in an array of positive integers and returns
an integer representing the maximum sum of non-adjacent elements in the array.

If a sum cannot be generated, the function should return 0.

Sample input: `[75, 105, 120, 75, 90, 135]`

Sample output: `330 (75, 120, 135)`
