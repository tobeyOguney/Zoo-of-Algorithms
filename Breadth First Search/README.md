# Breadth first Search

You are given a Node class that has a name and an array of optional children Nodes. When put together,
Nodes form a simple tree-like structure. Implement the breadthFirstSearch method on the Node class,
which takes in an empty array, traverses the tree using the Breadth-rst Search approach (specically
navigating the tree from left to right), stores all of the Nodes' names in the input array, and returns it.

Sample input:
```
         A
       / | \
      B  C  D
     / \   / \
    E   F G   H
       / \ \
      I  J  K
```
Sample output: 
```
["A","B","C","D","E","F","G","H","I","J","K"]
```
