# Max Sum Increasing Subsequence

Given an non-empty array of integers, write a function that returns an array of length 2. The rst
element in the output array should be an integer value representing the greatest sum that can be
generated from a strictly-increasing subsequence in the array. The second element should be an
array of the numbers in that subsequence. A subsequence is dened as a set of numbers that are not
necessarily adjacent but that are in the same order as they appear in the array. Assume that there
will only be one increasing subsequence with the greatest sum.


Sample input:
```
[10, 70, 20, 30, 50, 11, 30]
```

Sample output:
```
[110, [10, 20, 30, 50]]
```
