## Disk Stacking

You are given a non-empty array of arrays. Each subarray holds three integers and represents a disk. These
integers denote each disk's width, depth, and height, respectively. Your goal is to stack up the disks and to
maximize the total height of the stack. A disk must have a strictly smaller width, depth, and height than any
other disk below it. Write a function that returns an array of the disks in the nal stack, starting with the top
disk and ending with the bottom disk. Note that you cannot rotate disks; in other words, the integers in each
subarray must represent [width, depth, height] at all times. Assume that there will only be one stack with the
greatest total height.

Sample input:
```
[[2, 1, 2], [3, 2, 3], [2, 2, 8], [2, 3, 4], [1, 3, 1], [4, 4, 5]]
```

Sample output:
```
[[2, 1, 2], [3, 2, 3], [4, 4, 5]]
```
