# Longest Common Subsequence

Implement a function that returns the longest subsequence common to two given strings.
A subsequence is defined as a group of characters that appear sequentially,
with no importance given to their actual position in a string.

In other words, characters do not need to appear consecutively in order to form a subsequence.

Assume that there will only be one longest common subsequence.

Sample input: `"ZXVVYZW", "XKYKZPW"`

Sample output: `["X", "Y", "Z", "W"]`
